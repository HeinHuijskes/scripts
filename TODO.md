# TODO

- Find out if there is a way to include an automatic help function that points to `~/scripts/bash/help/scripthelpname` automatically
- Add more packages to install.txt
- Write a script that can replace all occurences of a path with a new path in all files in all subfolders of a folder
- Add a script that can properly inject text in a file in a specific place or find a different way to do so
